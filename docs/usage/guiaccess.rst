Accessing the User Interface
============================
Once the front and back ends of the project have been deployed, the front end can be accessed using any device with a web browser.

#. Connect to the WiFi "Elephant-Vending-Machine" using the password (originally "urfSj6GeUCntSmx9")
#. Open a web browser and enter :code:`http://192.168.0.100:3000/` into the address bar.
#. You should now see the Vending Machine UI. Note, the back-end and front-end must be launched to see webpage.
